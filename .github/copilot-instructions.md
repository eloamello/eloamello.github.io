## Key Guidelines

- Make the commits in the format of conventional commits, example: for a fix, start the commit with "fix:" then write what was fixed, if you are refactoring, use "refactor:" to start the commit message.
- As branchs tem que seguir o padrão gitflow e conter o # da issue (exemplo, feature/12_corrige_alguma_coisa)
